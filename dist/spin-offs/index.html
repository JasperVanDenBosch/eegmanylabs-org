<h1>Frontal alpha asymmetry and personality traits</h1>
<p>Project lead: Sebastian Ocklenburg</p>
<p>“#EEGManyLabs Asymmetry” spin-off will leverage community engagement to record additional resting-state EEG data, and a set of personality questionnaires together with the replication attempts.</p>
<p>There is a large body of literature suggesting the existence of hemispheric asymmetries in alpha frequency band (8-13 hz) oscillation power over frontal EEG electrodes during resting state (Allen et al., 2018). Alpha is often assumed to reflect the absence of cognitive activity, so that a rightward alpha asymmetry would reflect leftward brain activation asymmetry (Ocklenburg et al., 2018). One of the central reasons for the interest of the neuroscience community in EEG alpha asymmetries are their links to both affective disorders and personality. It has been shown on the meta-analytical level that depression is associated with a relative increase in left frontal (compared to right frontal) alpha, reflecting a relative increase in right-frontal activity compared to healthy controls (Thibodeau, Jorgensen, &amp; Kim, 2006). Moreover, individual differences in EEG alpha asymmetries have been linked to emotion processing (Tomarken et al., 1992) as well as to personality and motivation differences (Harmon-Jones &amp; Gable, 2018).</p>
<p>The aim of the #EEGManyLabs Asymmetry spin-off is to shed light on the replicability of asymmetries in EEG alpha power (Reznik &amp; Allen, 2018, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.12965">10.1111/psyp.12965</a>) and their relation to personality traits.</p>

<h1>Automation</h1>
<p>Beyond individual replications, a spin-off team (“#EEGManyLabs Automation”) will implement automated analyses to investigate differences between manual and automated coding. Each Lead Replicating Lab will consider whether additional blinding is required during the analysis; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/fmri">e.g.</a>, by having manual analyses conducted by researchers who are blind with respect to the experimental conditions. Such blinded analyses will need to be reported as such in the replication attempt. The replicators will be expected to execute the previously agreed analysis script, which will provide an effect size for the meta-analysis. Preprocessed data will be provided to the Lead Replicating Lab for supplementary analyses of the aggregated dataset.</p>
<p>Analysis conducted by Replication Labs followed the respective analysis protocols compared with the automatic analysis developed by a group of analysts. This will provide a test of how analytical decisions such as manual or algorithmic artifact removal, selection of regions of interest can affect reproducibility.</p>

<h1>Resting State (#EEGML:RS)</h1>
<p><strong>What is the #EEGML:RS?</strong></p>
<p>This is a spin-off from #EEGManyLabs with the aim of leveraging these data collection plans to collect additional resting state data that can be openly shared amongst our community and used to provide additional insights above and beyond the core programme of work.</p>
<p><strong>What are the aims of the #EEGML:RS?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To create the world's largest open dataset of EEG resting state.</li>
<li>We believe that there is enormous value that could be gained from the availability of such a dataset- from providing a detailed characterisation of resting state across the population and contrasting with patient populations and mapping developmental trajectories to answering theoretical questions on the nature of the signal and its relationship with task-related activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of participating in the #EEGML:RS?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You will be offered co-authorship on #EEGManyLab spin-offs that make use of these data. For example, the most immediate publication will involve a conceptual replication tackling an age-old question on the relationship between frontal asymmetry and personality measures (which will be submitted to Cortex like other #EEGManyLabs papers). You can read more about that analysis <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/137hb1Y-6Gw_nnu3u_QlSY4Fa6GgkQa8pPZ1WewYK9ns/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
<li>You could use the dataset that will be generated for your own projects.</li>
<li>Through making the data publicly available, you will contribute to improving the quality of EEG resting state research.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do I need to do if my replication group wants to participate?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You will have to record an 8-minute EEG-Resting State sequence and ask participants to fill out some standard questionnaires (15-20 min).</li>
<li>Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pxR57Is4AI8g-hNkECgUxxakWxgi54kU0jfWX8gbs84/edit">onboarding tutorial</a> for a more-detailed protocol</li>
<li>If you have any further questions, please add your comments to the protocol, or email us at <a href="mailto:sebastian.Ocklenburg@ruhr-uni-bochum.de">sebastian.ocklenburg@ruhr-uni-bochum.de</a> or <a href="mailto:pavlovug@gmail.com">pavlovug@gmail.com</a></li>
