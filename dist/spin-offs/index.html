<h2>100 years of EEG (1924-2024)</h2>
<p><img alt="printing_eeg" src="/assets/images/figures/printing_eeg.jpg" title="EEG printing on paper" /></p>
<p>In July 2024 it will be exactly 100 years since the first human EEG was recorded.
Much has happened since then and in light of ongoing developments on hardware, software, and theory side the method might still be about to grow to its full potential. People in various scientific organisations are working to celebrate this jubilee throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Automation</h2>
<p><img alt="processor" src="/assets/images/figures/processor.jpg" title="Processor Chip" /></p>
<p>This team will implement automated analyses to investigate differences between manual and automated coding. This will provide a test of how analytical decisions such as manual or algorithmic artifact removal, selection of regions of interest can affect reproducibility.</p>

<h2>Resting State</h2>
<p><img alt="sleep_eeg" src="/assets/images/figures/sleep_eeg.png" title="Child sleeping with EEG electrodes" /></p>
<p>This project aims to create the world's largest open dataset of EEG resting state. This can provide a detailed characterisation of resting state across the population and mapping developmental trajectories to answering questions on the nature of the signal and its relationship with task-related activity.</p>

<h2>Asymmetry and personality traits</h2>
<p><img alt="matrix" src="/assets/images/figures/personality_matrix.png" title="Personality Matrix" /></p>
<p>“#EEGManyLabs Asymmetry” spin-off will leverage community engagement to record additional resting-state EEG data, and a set of personality questionnaires together with the replication attempts.</p>

<h2>Prediction Markets</h2>
<p><img alt="bidding" src="/assets/images/figures/bidding.jpg" title="Bidding" /></p>
<p>Many readers familiar with these studies will have their own perspective about the likelihood of individual studies replicating. This will be the focus of the prediction markets. We will be able to examine how closely internally held beliefs in the EEG community map on to the replication results.</p>
