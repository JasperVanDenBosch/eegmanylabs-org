## What is EEGManyLabs?

an international network of researchers, aims to make a step towards understanding replicability of psychological findings from EEG research. We will assess the replicability of the results of some of the most important and influential EEG experiments of psychological phenomena
 
## Why do we need #EEGManyLabs?

Cognitive neuroscience research is expensive. As a result, published research tends to test novel hypotheses in small samples with highly multidimensional data-sets. While understandable, this approach has high potential for producing false positives and the replicability of novel, exciting findings goes largely untested. The EEGmanylabs initiative aims to change this by pooling resources across distributed laboratories to revisit existing EEG hypotheses with unprecedented statistical power.
