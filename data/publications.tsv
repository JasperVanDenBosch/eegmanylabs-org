Little effort is invested in replication projects and low power in many studies indicates a potentially poor state of research. To assess replicability of EEG research, the #EEGManyLabs project aims to reproduce the most influential original EEG studies. A spin-off to the main project shall investigate the relationship between frontal alpha asymmetries and psychopathological symptoms, the predictive qualities of which have lately been considered controversial. To ensure that preprocessing of EEG data can be conducted automatically (via Automagic), we tested 47 healthy participants in an EEG resting state paradigm and collected psychopathological measures. We analyzed reliability and quality of manual and automated preprocessing and performed multiple regressions to investigate the association of frontal alpha asymmetries and depression, worry, trait anxiety and COVID-19 related worry. We hypothesized comparably good interrater reliability of preprocessing methods and higher data quality in automatically preprocessed data. We expected associations of leftward frontal alpha asymmetries and higher depression and anxiety scores and significant associations of rightward frontal alpha asymmetries and higher worrying and COVID-19- related worrying. Interrater reliability of preprocessing methods was mostly good, automatically preprocessed data achieved higher quality scores than manually preprocessed data. We uncovered an association of relative rightward lateralization of alpha power at one electrode pair and depressive symptoms. No further associations of interest emerged. We conclude that Automagic is an appropriate tool for large-scale preprocessing. Findings regarding associations of frontal alpha asymmetries and psychopathology likely stem from sample limitations and shrinking effect sizes.

E	The relationship between political ideology and brain activity has captured the fascination of scientists and the public alike. Using approaches from cognitive neuroscience to provide insights into deeply held and personal beliefs requires careful navigation, with the application of robust methods that generate replicable results. A hallmark study in this area from Amodio et al. (2007) reported that brain components reflective of conflict monitoring and inhibition (namely the ERN [error-related negativity] and N2) are heightened in individuals who self-identify as liberal compared to conservative. While the study is highly influential and well-cited in the scientific literature, no direct replications of their findings exist and as such, this work was selected as a target replication for the #EEGManyLabs initiative. This cross-cultural multi-site study (N=320) will conduct a thorough replication of the Amodio et al. (2007) study, strictly adhering to the original protocol, namely by administering a Go/No-Go task with simultaneous EEG recording and a one-item scale asking participants to rate the extent to which they are liberal or conservative. We will supplement the original study with new measures that may better correspond to political identity in non-US contexts, such as religiosity, dogmatism, and traditionalism. In line with the original study, we will conduct correlational analyses between self-identified liberalism and ERN/N2 amplitudes. In addition, Bayesian linear regressions will be used to provide robust estimates of the strength of association between other components of political ideology and electrophysiological signals.

E	Visual working memory (VWM) is a temporary storage system capable of retaining information that can be accessed and manipulated by higher cognitive processes, thereby facilitating a wide range of cognitive functions. Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to understand the neural correlates of VWM with high temporal precision, and one commonly used EEG measure is an event-related potential called the contralateral delay activity (CDA). In a landmark study by Vogel and Machizawa (2004), the authors found that the CDA amplitude increases with the number of items stored in VWM and plateaus around three to four items, which is thought to represent the typical adult working memory capacity. Critically, this study also showed that the increase in CDA amplitude between two-item and four-item arrays correlated with individual subjects’ VWM performance. Although these results have been supported by subsequent studies, a recent study suggested that the number of subjects used in experiments investigating the CDA may not be sufficient to detect differences in set size and to provide a reliable account of the relationship between behaviorally measured VWM capacity and the CDA amplitude. To address this, the current study, as part of the #EEGManyLabs project, aims to conduct a multi-site replication of Vogel and Machizawa's (2004) seminal study on a large sample of participants, with a pre-registered analysis plan. Through this, our goal is to contribute to deepening our understanding of the neural correlates of visual working memory.	CDA; EEG; EEG Many Labs; Visual working memory

According to the Error-Related Reinforcement Learning Theory (Holroyd & Coles, 2002), the FRN amplitude is largest when the outcome is negative and unexpected. Complementing this, studies on the subsequent P300 have often reported larger amplitudes for positive than negative outcomes. In an influential ERP study, Hajcak et al.,(2005) manipulated outcome valence and expectancy in a guessing task. However, they found that the FRN component was larger for negative (no-reward) than positive (reward) outcomes, irrespective of expectancy. Conversely, the P300 component was larger for unexpected than expected outcomes, irrespective of valence. These results were at odds with prominent theories and extant literature. Here, we aim to replicate these results within the# EEGManyLabs project (Pavlov et al., 2021). Across thirteen labs we will not only undertake a close replication, but test the robustness of these effects to analytical choices (eg quantification of ERPs) and supplement the findings with Bayesian multilevel linear models to test for the reported absence of the effects.	
Schneider2022		https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr461874	preprint	PsyArXiv	Schneider et al	2022	20220224			10.31234/osf.io/vc3zg	Manual or Automatic? Putting standardized EEG-Preprocessing to the Test with the Alpha-Asymmetries of Personality		Evidence suggests that replication of empirical findings in many fields of research is seldom warranted. As a result, #EEGManyLabs Resting State EEG Asymmetry emerged to assess the replicability of landmark studies in psychophysiology. One potential factor that hinders replication is human subjectivity during EEG-preprocessing. To overcome this issue, the fully standardized preprocessing toolbox ‘Automagic’ (Pedroni, Bahreini, & Langer, 2019) was developed. The goal of the present work was to execute a test-run on Automagic to help assess its adequacy for the project’s purposes. Specifically, we examined the effect of automated preprocessing compared to traditional approaches on the analysis of frontal alpha asymmetries of personality. Forty-eight participants filled out the German BIS/BAS (Strobel, Beauducel, Debener, & Brocke, 2001) questionnaire, as well as the German RST-PQ Pugnaghi, Cooper, Ettinger, & Corr, 2018, among others. Next, we recorded 10 mins. of resting-state EEG twice, varying eye status (i.e., closed or opened) from each participant. All datasets were subsequently preprocessed in both Automagic and Brain Vision Analyzer. Measures based on signal amplitude as well as reliability estimates were computed to assess the quality of preprocessed EEG-data across methods. Furthermore, average alpha power from frontal, parietal, and occipital sites was extracted and used to compute asymmetry scores. Partial correlations between asymmetry scores and personality measures were computed, controlling for handedness, gender, and sleepiness. Additionally, we examined the moderating role of covariates using multiple regression analyses. Standardized preprocessing yielded better data quality in all considered aspects. No association between asymmetry scores and personality measures could be found, except when excluding influential data points. Employing different preprocessing approaches did not change our observations substantially. We consider standardized preprocessing a suitable option for large-scale multicentered replication projects. Our results support past research casting doubt on the robustness of the frontal alpha asymmetry of personality.	
Verona2023	Hajcak2003	https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr651907	preprint	PsyArXiv	Verona et al	2023	20230426	https://osf.io/6suf8/		10.31234/osf.io/8q4ks	Fear, Anxiety, and the Error-Related Negativity: A Registered Report of a Multi-Site Replication Study		The error-related negativity (ERN), a scalp-recorded neural index of error monitoring, was directly linked to anxiety in a highly influential paper by Hajcak et al. (2003), which found that individuals high in worry symptoms of anxiety show greater ERN amplitude than those low in worry. This research sparked a flurry of further investigations, with subsequent work proposing the ERN to be a putative neural marker for anxiety. However, almost two decades later, the robustness of the relationship between the ERN amplitude and anxiety has been called into question. As part of the #EEGManyLabs international collaborative (Pavlov et al., 2021), the proposed replication involves the collection of data from three highly-powered samples (n = 234 each) across nine collaborating sites in Germany, Norway, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, and the United States. Participants for the replication will be selected from a larger pool and assigned to the following three groups based on their scores on worry and phobia symptom scales: 1) high worry group, 2) high phobia/low worry group, and 3) low worry/phobia (control) group, with 70-80 participants in each group. All three groups of participants will complete a modified color-word Stroop task, consistent with procedures of Hajcak et al. (2003), while EEG recordings are made. As per Hajcak et al. (2003), we expect a significant main effect of group, with a larger overall ERN in the worry group than in the phobia and control groups, suggesting that enhanced sensitivity to errors is specific to worry vs. phobia. In addition to individual analyses conducted within each replicating lab, we will pool data across study sites and fit a two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis. Replication of this study will help in further characterizing the ERN signal and its link to clinical phenomena.	
Ganis2024	Eimer1993	https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr788371	preprint	Psyarxiv	Ganis et al	2024	20240115			10.31234/osf.io/nyj3f	The contribution of stimulus frequency and attention to the N2 and P3 in Go/Nogo: A multilab replication and new analyses		Numerous EEG studies have found that stimuli that require withholding a response (Nogo stimuli) elicit two scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs), the frontal N2 and the frontocentral P3, that are larger than for stimuli that require a response (Go stimuli). The functional significance of these ERPs is not entirely clear, with some accounts focusing on inhibitory processes, and others focusing on a conflict monitoring explanation. Our understanding of the role of these components is further complicated by the presence of potential confounds in traditional Go/Nogo tasks. One important confound present in many studies is the lower frequency of Nogo stimuli relative to Go stimuli. Since the N2 and P3 are generally modulated by stimulus frequency and novelty, the Nogo enhancement could reflect an automatic mismatch process elicited by infrequent Nogo stimuli. A seminal study by Eimer (1993) involved matching the probability of Go/Nogo stimuli to test the contribution of stimulus frequency and manipulating spatial attention to test the explanation that an automatic stimulus mismatch process could be driving these differences. Such an explanation for the frontal N2 predicts that there should be no modulation of frontal N2 Go/Nogo effects by spatial attention. Results showed a larger N2 and P3 for Nogo than Go stimuli, indicating that stimulus frequency is not the determinant factor for these effects. Furthermore, N2 and P3 Go/Nogo effects were modulated by the attentional cue, suggesting that they are not the result of an automatic mismatch process. Subsequent research has also shown larger N2 and P3 amplitudes for Nogo stimuli when Go and Nogo stimuli are equiprobable, but the results have not been entirely consistent because of variability in the paradigms used. The purpose of the present study is to directly replicate the original study by Eimer (1993) and to test the robustness of the results to variations in the analysis pipelines. As part of the #EEGManyLabs project, 5 labs will independently replicate the original study, resulting in a multisite replication with high statistical power. Individual replications will also be integrated via a meta-analysis. Together, these studies will provide important information about the replicability of classic EEG findings and advance our understanding of the role of the frontal N2 and frontocentral P3 during inhibition tasks.
