Shuermann2022	Preprint Manuscript	Schürmann N	Enabling #EEGManyLabs: Quality in Automatically Preprocessed EEG Data and Psychopathological Associations of Frontal Alpha Asymmetry			2022	eegmanylabs			2022-01		http://dx.doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/g8udv;https://osf.io/preprints/osf/g8udv	10.31219/osf.io/g8udv	"Neuroscience is facing a replication crisis. Little effort is invested in replication projects and low power in many studies indicates a potentially poor state of research. To assess replicability of EEG research, the #EEGManyLabs project aims to reproduce the most influential original EEG studies. A spin-off to the main project shall investigate the relationship between frontal alpha asymmetries and psychopathological symptoms, the predictive qualities of which have lately been considered controversial. To ensure that preprocessing of EEG data can be conducted automatically (via Automagic), we tested 47 healthy participants in an EEG resting state paradigm and collected psychopathological measures. We analyzed reliability and quality of manual and automated preprocessing and performed multiple regressions to investigate the association of frontal alpha asymmetries and depression, worry, trait anxiety and COVID-19 related worry. We hypothesized comparably good interrater reliability of preprocessing methods and higher data quality in automatically preprocessed data. We expected associations of leftward frontal alpha asymmetries and higher depression and anxiety scores and significant associations of rightward frontal alpha asymmetries and higher worrying and COVID-19- related worrying. Interrater reliability of preprocessing methods was mostly good, automatically preprocessed data achieved higher quality scores than manually preprocessed data. We uncovered an association of relative rightward lateralization of alpha power at one electrode pair and depressive symptoms. No further associations of interest emerged. We conclude that Automagic is an appropriate tool for large-scale preprocessing. Findings regarding associations of frontal alpha asymmetries and psychopathology likely stem from sample limitations and shrinking effect sizes."

E"	Error- and inhibitory-related brain activity associated with political ideology: A multi-site replication study			2023	eegmanylabs			2023-01		http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/39vqj;https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/39vqj	10.31234/osf.io/39vqj	"The relationship between political ideology and brain activity has captured the fascination of scientists and the public alike. Using approaches from cognitive neuroscience to provide insights into deeply held and personal beliefs requires careful navigation, with the application of robust methods that generate replicable results. A hallmark study in this area from Amodio et al. (2007) reported that brain components reflective of conflict monitoring and inhibition (namely the ERN [error-related negativity] and N2) are heightened in individuals who self-identify as liberal compared to conservative. While the study is highly influential and well-cited in the scientific literature, no direct replications of their findings exist and as such, this work was selected as a target replication for the #EEGManyLabs initiative. This cross-cultural multi-site study (N=320) will conduct a thorough replication of the Amodio et al. (2007) study, strictly adhering to the original protocol, namely by administering a Go/No-Go task with simultaneous EEG recording and a one-item scale asking participants to rate the extent to which they are liberal or conservative. We will supplement the original study with new measures that may better correspond to political identity in non-US contexts, such as religiosity, dogmatism, and traditionalism. In line with the original study, we will conduct correlational analyses between self-identified liberalism and ERN/N2 amplitudes. In addition, Bayesian linear regressions will be used to provide robust estimates of the strength of association between other components of political ideology and electrophysiological signals."

Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to understand the neural correlates of VWM with high temporal precision, and one commonly used EEG measure is an event-related potential called the contralateral delay activity (CDA). In a landmark study by Vogel and Machizawa (2004), the authors found that the CDA amplitude increases with the number of items stored in VWM and plateaus around three to four items, which is thought to represent the typical adult working memory capacity. Critically, this study also showed that the increase in CDA amplitude between two-item and four-item arrays correlated with individual subjects’ VWM performance. Although these results have been supported by subsequent studies, a recent study suggested that the number of subjects used in experiments investigating the CDA may not be sufficient to detect differences in set size and to provide a reliable account of the relationship between behaviorally measured VWM capacity and the CDA amplitude. To address this, the current study, as part of the #EEGManyLabs project, aims to conduct a multi-site replication of Vogel and Machizawa's (2004) seminal study on a large sample of participants, with a pre-registered analysis plan. Through this, our goal is to contribute to deepening our understanding of the neural correlates of visual working memory."	CDA; EEG; EEG Many Labs; Visual working memory
